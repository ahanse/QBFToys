# QBF converter and related tools 

There are three tools: 

1. `converter.hs` to convert QBF in .qudimacs format to THF conjectures. This tool can be used to "repair" problems given in .qdimacs problems.
2. `generateBenchmarks.py` to preprocess and convert a folder containing QBF problems
3. `runBenchmarks.py` to run a benchmark on the files generated by "generateBenchmarks.py"

All tools should output usage informations if called without command line arguments.

# Compilation

To compile the haskell script, run:

```
ghc -O2 --make converter.hs
```
